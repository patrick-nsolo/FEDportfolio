        <h2>About Me</h2> 
        <p>
        I am an enthusiastic and dedicated software developer, fluent in English, 
        with expertise in WordPress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and related frameworks [React]. 
        My journey in web design has been primarily self-taught, fueled by an unwavering 
        commitment to continual learning and improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have actively dedicated my time and effort to participating in several open-source 
        projects and communities through software development, graphic design, documentation, 
        and more.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition to my proficiency in web development, I possess advanced graphic design 
        and video editing skills, adeptly using tools such as Photoshop, Inkscape, Figma, 
        Davinci Resolve, and Microsoft Clipchamp. This allows me to offer a comprehensive 
        range of services to enhance the visual aspects of your project.
